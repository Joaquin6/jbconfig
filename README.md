## Prerequisites

### Homebrew, iTerm2 and Zsh

* If you havenâ€™t already, install the mac package manager [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation.html).
* Install the terminal [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html) here or through homebrew using `brew cask install iterm2`
* Then install the shell [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) (a alternative to [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29)) using `brew install zsh`
* Open iTerm2. To change the default shell to Zsh rather than bash, run the change shell command in your terminal. `chsh -s /bin/zsh`

The Zsh resource file, `~/.zshrc`, is a script that is run whenever you start Zsh.
